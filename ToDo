> Future Improvements:
	- Expand Keyboard controls (tabbing for menu items, enter to select, etc.)
	- In "Options" screen, add swatches to display palette used by cards.
	- Add option to select different pre-created card backs.
	- Update themes so that checkboxButtons do not use words and instead use images of a tick and an x to signify "on" and "off".
	- Add French translation

> Bugs:
	- Touch screen does not work in browsers as mouse click.

> Limitations:
	- Allow unpausing via "escape" button : Cannot be achieved as _input and _input_event are not called while game is paused.
