> Desired features:
	- Option to start game on last page of the "how to" screen.

> Future Improvements:
	- Expand Keyboard controls (tabbing for menu items, enter to select, etc.)
	- In "Options" screen, add swatches to display palette used by cards.
	- Add option to select different pre-created card backs.
	- Use localization/translation features to add other language options. 

Bugs:
