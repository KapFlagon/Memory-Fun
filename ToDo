Future Improvements:
> Expand Keyboard controls (tabbing for menu items, enter to select, etc.)
> In "Options" screen, add swatches to display palette used by cards.
> Add option to select different pre-created card backs.

Bug fixes:
> Users can select a background colour that is full white or full black, which could hide some text
	- Option 1: Dynamically colour the text based on the background colour
	- Option 2: restrict the colours available to save as background colour
	- Option 3: Leverage signal color_changed and validate selection? 
	- Option 4: Select a hue threshold, and if the user selects that then the values auto-snap to a more acceptable value.
> Need to validate user input for name submission
	- Restrict length
> Reset button to restore factory configurations
